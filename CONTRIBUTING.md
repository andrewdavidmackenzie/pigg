# Contributing to `pigg`
We welcome your contributions to "pigg"!

You should read and agree to the contributor covent, to make sure you are able to comply with how we'd like this community to run and behave (no matter how small it may be!).

## Ways to Contribute
Ways you can contribute are:
* Clone the repo and build from source (`make`) or `cargo install pigg` (once we have it published)
* Feedback and comments via Discussions in GitHub, or reddit or other methods when we have them setup
* Creating issues for bugs you find
* Creating issues for ideas of improvements or new features
* Creating issues (for now) with examples of how you have used it, configurations you have created and the associated hardware or functionality enabled via the Pi
* Commenting on existing issues for bugs, enhacements, new features roadmap, etc.
* Code contributions via a PR, that describes what the PR brings

## Raspberry Pi Expertise
We started this project, mainly as a learning exercise related to using rust, iced and rppal on Raspberry Pi hardware. 

We are not Raspberry Pi hardware experts, and we still have a lot to learn about the many advanced uses of GPIO on Raspberry Pi, 
functionality such as I2C buses, SPI, UART, DPI etc.

We are particularly interested in contributions from experts in the Pi hardware and how to configure and use those hardware functionalities,
and how to connect them to a GUI experience in interesting and useful ways.

So, if you are knowledgeable in use of specific Pi hardware features beyond simple Input/Output, please give `pigg` a try,
be patient with us as the first releases will be very simple and limited in functionality, and help us improve it, in any of the ways of
contributing listed above!

## Code Contribution Workflow
The code contribution workflow is just standard:
* Fork the repo
* Modify or add to the code
* Push commits (with good commit messages) to your fork
* Create a Pull Request to this repo. Reference an issue if one exists (you can use smart commit messages like "Fixes #123". If not describe what the PR does.
* We will review and either request some changes, or merge.

If you become a regular contributor and wish to join the team, then we can add you to this repo as a contributor and you can work on branches of this repo and a streamlined workflow.
